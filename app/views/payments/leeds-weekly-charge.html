        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Pay a Leeds Clean Air Zone weekly charge</h1>
        <p>The weekly charge for your vehicle is:</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Â£50.00</h2>
        <p>The weekly charge lets you drive the same vehicle into the Leeds Clean Air Zone as often as you like within any 7-day period.</p>
        <p>You must pay for the weekly charge either on the first day you drive or by midnight the day after you drive through a Clean Air Zone.</p>

            <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
                <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
                If you don't pay by midnight the day after you drive in the zone, you'll get a fine. This is also known as a penalty charge notice (PCN).
