        <p>The daily charge for your vehicle is:</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">£8.00</h2>
        <p>You must pay the Clean Air charge by midnight the day after you drive through a Clean Air Zone.</p>
        <p>You only need to pay once, no matter how many times you drive in and out of that Clean Air Zone on the same day.</p>

                If you don't pay by midnight on the day after you drove in the zone, you'll get a fine. This is also known as a penalty charge notice (PCN).
